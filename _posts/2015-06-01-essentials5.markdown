If you know how to use a hot glue gun, you will be comfortable at soldering. It just requires the proper equipment, good eyesight, and a steady hand. The best tutorial is by Adafruit [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-guide-excellent-soldering). This article will give you an overview of soldering and some 'hot tips' on how to master this essentials skill.

### Why do I need to solder?

- a soldering iron
- solder (it comes in coils)
- some way to hold your components steady while you work (a vise, 'second hand clip', or clothespin can work)
- a heat-proof plate or tile to rest your soldering iron

While a lot of projects can work fine plugging wires into a breadboard or even a simple twist around an LED sequin, when you need to create a more permanent connection between a wire and two components, you'll need to solder. Soldering involves taking a special kind of metal wrapped around a meltable resin core. The metal is a 60/40 mix of tin and lead which melts at 370 degrees Fahrenheit. You use an electrical soldering iron, which is like a hot wand, to melt the solder over the joint. The end goal is to create a little 'onion dome' over the end of your wire, making a tight connection between the wire and component.

### Tips and Tricks

- Use a clothespin to hold your component steady
- Hold the solder to the joint between the elements you are connection and use the soldering iron to melt the iron evenly around the projecting wire
- Be careful setting down your hot iron. It will melt through plastic and burn holes in cloth
- Make sure your solder does not touch any other part of the component to avoid short circuits
- Made a mistake? To de-solder, re-melt the solder and use a q-tip to wick the metal away. This takes time and you can damage your components, so try not to make mistakes!
